# BSidesPDX CTF 2018

These are my solutions, recreations, and notes on the BSidesPDX CTF 2018. Most
of these programs are fairly brittle and not amazing because I was under a
time-crunch and didn't really care about them working super well, as long as I
got the flag. That being said, I did put _some_ effort into them. The servers I
just wrote real quickly for fun, so they're not super pretty code either.
